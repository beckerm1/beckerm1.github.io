## Computer Science Capstone - Michael Becker

This Github page contains my SNHU Computer Science Capstone project and deliverables. Our goal was to take an existing artifact from a previous course and provide several enhancements. I chose to enhance a Pet Check-In application. 

### Code Review

An initial code review was performed on the artifact. The purpose of the code review was to identify the enhancements that could be made to the code. The main enhancements that I planned were: 
- Porting code over to Python instead of Java
- Adding Pandas dataframe functionality instead of class management
- Adding database functionality to store data before closing the application
- Adding a main function to function as the application. 

### Software Design

The main enhancement for my software design was porting my code over to Python. To implement this, I took my Java classes and created accompanying pseudocode. Then I coded the application in Python. 

### Algorithms and Data Structure

One addition I had to make was adding a main function to the application. This could then perform the main logic for the application. I also implemented Pandas dataframe structuring to handle my application data and search results. 

### Databases

The final addition was implementing a sqllite database at the end of the application. This allows the data to be stored when the application closes. It takes the dataframe and stores it as a database table.
